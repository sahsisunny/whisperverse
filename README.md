# Whisperverse

Whisperverse is a dynamic web application that allows users to share and explore anonymous secrets. The application is built with a Full Stack approach, utilizing technologies such as React.js, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, and various other tools to provide a seamless and secure experience.

## Overview

The project is structured into two main folders: `client` for the frontend and `backend` for the server-side components.

### Backend

The backend of Whisperverse is developed using the following technologies:

- **Express**: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords to enhance security.
- **Passport**: Integrated for Google OAuth 2.0 authentication.

### Frontend

The frontend of Whisperverse is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Typescript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive designs.
- **RTK Query**: A data fetching and state management library for React applications.
