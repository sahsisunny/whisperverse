# Whisperverse Frontend

Welcome to the Whisperverse Frontend! This is built with Next.js and TypeScript, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface for the Whisperverse application.

## Overview

The Whisperverse frontend interacts with the backend to enable users to post secrets and explore secrets shared by others. It's designed using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive layout and uses RTK Query for efficient data fetching and state management.

## Cloning

To clone the frontend repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahsisunny/whisperverse.git
cd whisperverse/client
```

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

2. Run the frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The frontend development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Constants

The API constants are stored in the `constants` file. If you need to update the API endpoints or make any modifications related to API communication, you can find and edit them in this file.


Ensure that the `API` matches the URL where your Whisperverse backend is hosted.

Now, the Whisperverse Frontend is ready to be explored and modified as needed. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out!
